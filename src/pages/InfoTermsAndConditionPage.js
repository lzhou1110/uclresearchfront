                <p>The personal data are used for authentication and statistical purposes, and for the purposes of the
                    management of the service (including registration and access to data). They are also used for other
                    lawful purposes notified to the user where user(s) have been given the opportunity to withdraw
                    consent.
                </p>

                <p>Personal data relating to access to a particular data collection (e.g. in the form of a data usage
                    report) may only ever be passed to:

                        <li>the depositors and distributors of the data</li>
                        <li>copyright and other intellectual property rights owners of the data collection</li>
                        <li>the funders of the project</li>
                        <li>in exceptional circumstances, the userâ€™s own institution or organisation</li>

                <p>To ensure effective management of the service, personal data are retained for 50 years from the date
                    of first registration. At the end of that period and subject to the individual no longer being
                    registered, data which could identify that individual user will be removed from the database, though
                    anonymised data are retained to facilitate reporting and statistical analysis. The anonymised data
                    which are retained are:</p>

                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>date of registration</li>
                        <li>date of last amendment</li>
                        <li>internal user database unique id</li>
                        <li>details of any data accessed/downloaded</li>
                        <li>details of invitation links generated using user email (with email removed)</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p>Users may at any time request withdrawal of registration. At this point, contact details will be
                    removed, ensuring that no further communication will be received. However, for contractual reasons,
                    remaining personal data are subject to the same retention policy stated above.</p>

                <p>Registered users may access their personal data online at any time by logging in to their
                    account.</p>
